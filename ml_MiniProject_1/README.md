# Machine Learning Mini Project 1
## Description
This repository contains the first mini-project of the machine learning course at KNTU University. The mini-project consists of three problems:
1. **Classification Task**: Using `sklearn.datasets` and `sklearn.linear_model` for classification. This problem involves showing the dataset and the boundaries after training.
2. **CWRU Bearing Dataset Classification**: Classifying normal and raw data using the CWRU Bearing dataset. This involves preparing the dataset, extracting features, and using `sklearn.linear_model` for classification.
3. **Regression Problem**: Using the 2006-2016 Szeged Weather dataset for a regression task. Methods used include Least Squares (LS), Recursive Least Squares (RLS), and Weighted Least Squares (WLS).
