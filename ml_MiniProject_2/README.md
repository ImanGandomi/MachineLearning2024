# Machine Learning Mini Project 2

## Description
This repository contains the second mini project of the machine learning course at KNTU University. The mini project consists of four problems:

1. **McCulloch-Pitts Neuron**: Creating three boundaries to form a triangle using McCulloch-Pitts neurons with 2000 random data points in a known area.
2. **CWRU Bearing Dataset Classification**: Classifying the CWRU Bearing dataset into four classes (one normal and three fault classes) using an MLP model with at least two layers. Evaluation metrics include confusion matrix and classification report, with k-fold cross-validation.
3. **Decision Tree**: Using the Drugs A, B, C, X, Y dataset from Kaggle for decision tree classification, followed by random forest.
4. **Bayes Classification**: Classifying the Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle using Bayes classification.
