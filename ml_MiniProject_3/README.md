# Machine Learning Mini Project 3

## Description
This repository contains the third mini project of the machine learning course at KNTU University. The mini project consists of two problems:

1. **SVM on IRIS Dataset**: Using SVM to classify the IRIS dataset. First plot the data using t-SNE, then classify using linear and nonlinear kernels in SVM.
2. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**: Implementing the article "Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Autoencoder Neural Network" ([arXiv:1908.11553](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.11553)) and achieving the same results.
