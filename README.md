# MachineLearning2024
## Introduction
Welcome to the Machine Learning course repository for KNTU University, taught by Dr. Aliyari. This course takes place in the second semester of the year 1403 and consists of four mini-projects designed to provide hands-on experience with various machine-learning techniques and tools. Each mini-project focuses on different aspects of machine learning, from classification and regression to neural networks and model evaluation.

Feel free to explore the projects and contribute to the repository.

## Mini-Project Descriptions


### Mini Project 1: Fundamental Machine Learning Techniques
1. **Problem 1: Classification with Scikit-Learn**
   - Using `sklearn.datasets` and `sklearn.linear_model` for classification and visualizing decision boundaries.
2. **Problem 2: CWRU Bearing Dataset Classification**
   - Preparing the CWRU Bearing dataset, extracting features, and classifying using a linear model.
3. **Problem 3: Weather Data Regression**
   - Performing regression on the 2006-2016 Szeged Weather dataset using LS, RLS, and weighted LS methods.
  
### Mini Project 2: Advanced Classification Techniques
1. **Problem 1: McCulloch-Pitts Neuron Triangle**
   - Creating three boundaries to form a triangle using McCulloch-Pitts neurons with 2000 random data points.
2. **Problem 2: MLP Classification of CWRU Bearing Dataset**
   - Classifying the CWRU Bearing dataset into four classes using an MLP model with evaluation metrics and k-fold cross-validation.
3. **Problem 3: Decision Tree and Random Forest**
   - Classifying the Drugs A, B, C, X, Y dataset from Kaggle using decision trees and random forest.
4. **Problem 4: Bayes Classification on Heart Disease Dataset**
   - Using Bayes classification to classify the Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle.
  
### Mini Project 3: Support Vector Machines and Anomaly Detection
1. **Problem 1: SVM on IRIS Dataset**
